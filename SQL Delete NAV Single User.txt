"HOW TO RESET" NAV SINGLE USER
If you have some issues with NAV single user, you can delete ALL user configuration and after recreate a new user
follow this procedure:

1) FIRST: SELECT [User Security ID] from USERNAME
use DB
GO

retrieve User Security ID (User ID by uniqueidentifier)
select [User Security ID] from [dbo].[User] where [User Name] = 'DOMAIN\USER1' 
    --> example: User Security ID output:  49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2  (User ID by uniqueidentifier)

2) SECOND: DELETE using [USer Security ID] extrected from user name
delete [dbo].[Access Control] where [User Security ID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
delete [dbo].[Page Data Personalization]  where [User SID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
delete [dbo].[User Metadata]  where [User SID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
delete [dbo].[User Property] where [User Security ID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
delete [dbo].[User Personalization] where [User SID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
delete [dbo].[User Default Style Sheet] where [User ID] = N'49089BA8-91C5-4BD2-A322-7797760736B2'
GO

NB: STOP NAV SERVICE BEFORE DELETING from SQL !!/

STOP NAV SERVER Service (you can't delete users from SQL with NAV server active- "USER" table is locked)

3) LAST: delete user (and after recreate form NAV)
delete [dbo].[User] where [User Name] = 'DOMAIN\USER1' 
GO

** If you have NAV pending services, use KIll service script below:
KILLING PROCEDURE

Kill Service Script
sc queryex MicrosoftDynamicsNavServer$ITA
  result --> Service Name 
             Process ID : PID 10484

taskkill /PID 10484 /F
  result --> process killed

Have a nice day !
